# Tabbed UI Implementation Notes

## Overview

The SABRE GUI now uses a modern tabbed notebook interface where all panels are directly embedded in tabs rather than opened as separate windows. This provides a more integrated and user-friendly experience.

## Main Features

- **Tabbed Interface**: All functionality is organized into logical tabs
  - Main
  - Advanced Parameters
  - Testing (with embedded sub-tabs)
  - SLIC Control
  - Polarization Calculator

- **Tab Overflow Management**: Tabs that don't fit in the window are automatically moved to an overflow menu.

- **Tab Detachment**: Tabs can be detached into separate windows for multi-monitor setups or focused work.

## Implementation Details

### Panel Classes

All panel classes now support being embedded within a parent frame:

- `VirtualTestingPanel`: Modified to work either as a standalone window or embedded in a tab
- `AnalogInputPanel`: Modified to support embedded mode
- `AnalogOutputPanel`: Modified to support embedded mode
- `FullFlowSystem`: Modified to support embedded mode
- `SLICSequenceControl`: Modified to support embedded mode
- `PolarizationApp`: Modified to support embedded mode

The embedded panels are instantiated using `embedded=True` parameter, which causes them to:
1. Initialize as a Frame instead of a Toplevel window
2. Use the provided parent container
3. Skip window-specific setup (like title, window management)

### Tab Organization

- **Main Tab**: General parameters, experiment control, waveform and magnetic field views
- **Advanced Parameters Tab**: Complete parameter configuration interface
- **Testing Tab**: Nested tabbed interface with:
  - Virtual Testing panel
  - Analog Input panel
  - Valve Control panel
  - Analog Output panel
- **SLIC Control Tab**: Embedded SLIC sequence control interface
- **Polarization Cal Tab**: Embedded polarization calculator

### Tab Detachment

Users can detach any tab by clicking on its tab label. This creates a new window with the same content.
Each detached tab maintains a connection to the main application for data sharing and control.

## User Experience

The new UI provides a more integrated experience where:
- All functionality is immediately visible and accessible
- Related features are grouped together logically
- The interface is more space-efficient, fitting more functionality in the same screen area
- Users can create custom layouts by detaching tabs when needed

## Technical Notes

- The tab system is built using `ttk.Notebook` for modern appearance
- Tab overflow is managed dynamically based on available space
- Embedded panels maintain functionality while being more integrated
- All major panels support being embedded in a parent frame or running standalone
