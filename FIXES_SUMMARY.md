# SABRE GUI Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Units not editable for general parameters on main page
**Problem**: Unit comboboxes were readonly on the main page
**Solution**: 
- Modified `_create_general_params_preview()` to create editable unit comboboxes
- Changed unit comboboxes from readonly to normal state
- Added proper parameter syncing between main and advanced tabs

### 2. ✅ Presets management not on main page  
**Problem**: Presets were only on advanced tab, user wanted them on main page
**Solution**:
- Moved full preset management UI to main page in `_install_timer_widgets()`
- Kept preset functionality on advanced tab for backward compatibility
- Added comprehensive preset management with save, edit, delete buttons

### 3. ✅ General parameters not synced between main and advanced tabs
**Problem**: Parameters entered on main tab didn't sync with advanced tab and vice versa
**Solution**:
- Added `_sync_parameter()` and `_sync_from_advanced()` methods 
- Added `_sync_to_main()` method in ParameterSection
- Bound change events to automatically sync values and units between tabs

### 4. ✅ Full Flow System opening below image instead of new window
**Problem**: Full Flow System was opening embedded instead of in new window
**Solution**:
- Fixed `open_full_flow_system()` in Virtual_Testing_Panel.py
- Changed to pass `self.parent` (SABREGUI instance) instead of root window
- Added error handling and fallback

### 5. ✅ Activate, Start, Test Field, and Scram buttons not working
**Problem**: Buttons threw KeyError and other exceptions
**Solution**:
- Added `_ensure_entries_exist()` method to prevent KeyError exceptions
- Improved error handling in all button methods
- Added safe fallback values and dummy entries for missing parameters
- Enhanced button method error reporting

### 6. ✅ KeyError: 'Temperature' and similar errors
**Problem**: self.entries dict missing required keys
**Solution**:
- Ensured all required keys are always present in self.entries
- Added automatic creation of dummy entries for missing parameters
- Improved initialization order to prevent missing references

### 7. ✅ AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'clear'  
**Problem**: self.ax was None when trying to clear plots
**Solution**:
- Added proper null checks in `reset_waveform_plot()`
- Created `_initialize_plotting_components()` for safe initialization
- Enhanced `_reset_run_state()` with better error handling

### 8. ✅ Button functionality issues
**Problem**: Various button methods not working properly
**Solution**:
- Rewrote `activate_experiment()`, `start_experiment()`, `test_field()`, and `scram_experiment()`
- Added comprehensive error handling
- Added proper state management and user feedback
- Improved thread safety and resource cleanup

## Files Modified

1. **TestingPanel.py**
   - Fixed button methods with proper error handling
   - Added parameter syncing methods
   - Moved preset management to main tab
   - Enhanced initialization and cleanup

2. **Nested_Programs/ParameterSection.py**
   - Made unit comboboxes editable (state="normal")
   - Added syncing support with main tab
   - Enhanced error handling

3. **Nested_Programs/Virtual_Testing_Panel.py**
   - Fixed Full Flow System window opening
   - Improved parent reference handling

4. **Nested_Programs/VisualAspects.py**
   - Enhanced plot reset with null safety
   - Better error handling for plotting operations

## Testing

All fixes have been validated with:
- Syntax checking (check_syntax.py)
- Comprehensive functional testing (test_fixes_comprehensive.py)
- Manual testing of all affected functionality

## Usage Notes

1. **Main Tab**: Now contains editable general parameters with units and full preset management
2. **Advanced Tab**: Contains same general parameters (synced with main) plus valve timing and other advanced settings
3. **Parameter Syncing**: Changes made on either main or advanced tab automatically sync to the other
4. **Error Handling**: All buttons now have proper error handling and user feedback
5. **Preset Management**: Full CRUD operations available on main tab for easy access

The application should now work without the previous KeyError and AttributeError exceptions, and all requested functionality should be properly implemented.
