# SABRE GUI Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored the monolithic `SABREGUI` class into a well-organized, modular architecture following SOLID principles. The main class now serves as a coordinator that initializes and delegates to focused controllers.

## Classes Extracted

### Phase 1: Initial Controllers
1. **WindowManager** (`Nested_Programs/WindowManager.py`)
   - Manages detached windows and panel creation
   - Handles opening various test panels (AI, AO, SLIC, Polarization, etc.)

2. **PresetController** (`Nested_Programs/PresetController.py`)
   - Handles all preset-related functionality
   - Manages preset loading, parameter mapping, and auto-filling

3. **WaveformController** (`Nested_Programs/WaveformController.py`)
   - Handles live waveform plotting and management
   - Manages waveform refresh and updates

4. **CountdownController** (`Nested_Programs/CountdownController.py`)
   - Handles timer functionality (renamed from TimerController)

5. **WidgetSynchronizer** (`Nested_Programs/WidgetSynchronizer.py`)
   - Handles synchronization between original and cloned widgets
   - Manages widget value synchronization in detached windows

6. **TooltipManager** (`Nested_Programs/TooltipManager.py`)
   - Manages all tooltip functionality across the application

### Phase 2: Core System Controllers
7. **ThemeManager** (`Nested_Programs/ThemeManager.py`)
   - Manages application themes and color schemes
   - Handles theme application to all UI components
   - Supports Light, Dark, High-Contrast, and Normal themes

8. **DAQController** (`Nested_Programs/DAQController.py`)
   - Handles all DAQ communication
   - Manages digital and analog signal output

9. **StateManager** (`Nested_Programs/StateManager.py`)
   - Manages system states and configurations
   - Loads configuration from JSON files

10. **PlotController** (`Nested_Programs/PlotController.py`)
    - Handles all plotting operations
    - Manages live plotting, waveform buffers, and plot visibility

11. **UIManager** (`Nested_Programs/UIManager.py`)
    - Handles UI creation and styling
    - Creates control buttons and error popups

12. **MethodManager** (`Nested_Programs/MethodManager.py`)
    - Handles polarization method selection and management
    - Loads methods from directory and manages bubbling time state

13. **TimerWidget** (`Nested_Programs/TimerWidget.py`)
    - Timer widget for countdown display
    - Standalone widget class for timing functionality

## Existing Modular Classes (Kept)
- `TabManager` - Manages tab creation and organization
- `ExperimentController` - Handles experiment execution
- `ScramController` - Handles emergency stop functionality
- `ParameterSection` - Manages parameter input sections
- `PresetManager` - Manages preset operations

## Main File Changes
- **Before**: ~3,700 lines with monolithic `SABREGUI` class
- **After**: ~2,900 lines with focused `SABREGUI` coordinator class
- **Reduction**: ~800 lines moved to separate, focused files

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle
Each class now has a focused responsibility:
- `ThemeManager`: Theme management only
- `DAQController`: DAQ communication only
- `PlotController`: Plotting operations only
- `UIManager`: UI creation and styling only
- etc.

### 2. Delegation Pattern
The main `SABREGUI` class now delegates specific tasks to appropriate controllers:
```python
def apply_theme(self, theme_name):
    """Delegate to theme manager"""
    return self.theme_manager.apply_theme(theme_name)

def create_control_button(self, parent, text, color, command):
    """Delegate to UI manager"""
    return self.ui_manager.create_control_button(parent, text, color, command)
```

### 3. Improved Maintainability
- Code organized by functionality rather than in one massive class
- Each controller can be modified independently
- Clear separation of concerns

### 4. Better Testability
- Each controller can be tested independently
- Easier to mock dependencies
- Unit tests can focus on specific functionality

### 5. Reduced Complexity
- Main class is significantly simpler and more focused
- Individual files are easier to understand and navigate
- Clear file organization in `Nested_Programs` directory

## Testing
- All extracted classes can be imported successfully
- Basic instantiation works correctly
- Core functionality tested and verified
- Application runs without import errors
- Original functionality preserved

## Status: COMPLETE ✅
The refactoring process has successfully transformed a monolithic class into a well-organized, modular architecture. The application maintains all original functionality while being significantly more maintainable and organized.

## Linter Notes
Some import resolution warnings remain in the IDE, but the application runs correctly. This is expected as the refactoring changed the import structure, and the modules exist and function properly at runtime.
